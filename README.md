This was written by me (0Zayn), and Ethan (ethanmcdonagh), and given the code name Ballistic, many upcoming new executors have been using this module, including but not limited to Artemis, Athena, Atlantis, and Protoware (NOTE: Protoware did not even have our permission, and claimed it was theirs).
Due to all this I have decided to leak the source to hopefully put a stop, and be able to have credit for our work.

Please feel free to do whatever with this, just not distribute it as your own product
